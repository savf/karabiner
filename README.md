# Karabiner SpaceFn & CommandTab

This private.xml file can be used with [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) to add a SpaceFn functionality, as well as a CommandTab setting to Karabiner.

## SpaceFn

The idea for SpaceFn is based on a [geekhack thread](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51069.0) by user spiceBar and proposes that the space bar should not only be used to produce the space character, but as a modifier, too.

When the space bar is pressed once, it produces a single space (" ") character, but in combination with other keys, it executes additional functions. 
Here is a list of possible key combinations:

Key combination        | Executed command
-----------------------|------------------------------
Space + aou            | äöü
Space + Command + hl   | Jump words forward/backward
Space + Command + jk   | Jump to beginning/end of line
Space + Backspace      | Delete

## CommandTab

I use the Caps Lock key as my Command key in Mac OS X and with **CommandTab** I can pack even more functionality into the Caps Lock key.

**Pressing** the Caps Locks key once, sends a tab character. **Holding** the Caps Lock key activates the Command modifier, which then works like always. This saves me from reaching up to the tab key and is especially useful when switching from more restricted keyboard layouts like for example on the [Planck](http://olkb.com/planck/).
